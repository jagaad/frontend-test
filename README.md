# Frontend Coding Challenge 🚀

Welcome to our frontend coding challenge! This is a great opportunity for you to showcase your frontend skills.
We're excited to see what you come up with! 🎨🖥️

## Overview 🌐

Your task is to create a simple e-commerce-like application that fetches product data
from a provided JSON file on GitHub and displays them with some interactive features.

Use any modern frontend framework/library (e.g., React, Vue, Angular, Nuxt, Next) with TypeScript.
Any styling solution is accepted.

## Data Source 📊

You will be fetching the product data from the [`mock-products.json`](mock-products.json) raw JSON file hosted in this repository.
Here's the link to the JSON file:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jagaad/frontend-test/main/mock-products.json
```

> The data was generated using [`@faker-js/faker`](https://fakerjs.dev/)

Each product in the JSON file has the following fields:

- `image`: URL to the product image (string)
- `title`: Name of the product (string)
- `description`: Brief description of the product (string)
- `price`: Price of the product (string)

## Requirements 📝
